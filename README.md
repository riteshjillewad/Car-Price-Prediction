# Car Price Prediction System

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts the price of a used car based on user inputs like brand, model, year, fuel type, and mileage. It's built using Python and some popular ML libraries and is deployed using Flask.

## About the Project

As a student passionate about machine learning, I built this project to apply regression techniques and get hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The goal is to provide a quick estimation of a car's selling price based on historical data.

## Tech Stack Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & Numpy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Flask**
- **HTML/CSS** (for the frontend UI)

## Features

- User can input car details like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.
- The model processes this data and predicts the car price.
- Simple Flask-based web interface.
- Visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA) included in Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app
   ```bash
   python app.py
